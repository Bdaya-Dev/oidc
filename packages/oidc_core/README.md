An [OpenId Connect RP (Relying Party)][spec_link] package for dart, which exposes basic models and functionality defined by the OIDC standard.

Make sure you read the [![Wiki](https://img.shields.io/badge/wiki-purple)](https://bdaya-dev.github.io/oidc/oidc_core) for how to use this package.

## Introduction

This package only requires dart, and can be used in all platforms.

Since the `OIDC` specification requires interactions with the underlying platform (e.g. launching a browser, listening for redirect, etc...), this package can't be used by it self to implement the spec.

The full spec is implemented in [package:oidc](https://github.com/Bdaya-Dev/oidc/tree/main/packages/oidc) which depends on flutter.

## Installation üíª

**‚ùó In order to start using this package you must have the [Dart SDK][dart_install_link] installed on your machine.**

Add to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```sh
dart pub add oidc_core
```

## Running Tests üß™

To run all unit tests:

```sh
dart pub global activate coverage 1.2.0
dart test --coverage=coverage
dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
open coverage/index.html
```
