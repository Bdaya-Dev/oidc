part of [![package:oidc_web_core][package_image]][package_link]

An implementation of `OidcStore` that uses [package:web](https://dart.dev/interop/js-interop/package-web) to store the data in local storage and session storage.

It's different from `package:oidc_default_store`, in that it does NOT depend on flutter, and can be used in dart web apps.
